# 👋 Hi, I’m silly-internet-tricks!

## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where userscripts and Linux obsessions run wild!

## 🏭 About Me
- **Factory Worker** @ an electronics assembly company by day
- **Script Sorcerer** by night (and sometimes at lunch breaks)
- Lifelong fan of Tampermonkey userscripting (if it can be customized, I’m on it!)
- Currently obsessed with programming in **Linux x86**—because why not go low-level?

## 🚀 Favorite Project
### [silly-internet-repo](https://github.com/silly-internet-tricks/silly-internet-repo)
> A collection of my silliest, most useful, and occasionally questionably brilliant userscripts.
